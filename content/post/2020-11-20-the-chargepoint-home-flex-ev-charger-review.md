We were an early adopter of the Chevrolet Bolt BEV, having owned one since its introductory year of 2017.  In 2020 after our second car died, we went out and got another one.  Having BEVs as all of our vehicles necesitates having a level 2 charger at home.  We've had a Siemens Versicharge as soon as we got the first Bolt.  It has been a capable charger and it was quite inexpensive.  However, it has a few shortcomings:
- It's a bit bulky.  We now mount it on a column instead of the wall where it can be a bit in the way.  We liked the ability to plug the charging cord connector into the front of the unit.  But in reality we mostly wrap the cord around the unit and let the connector hang to the side.
- It's not a smart charger, so we aren't able to monitor when it's done charging or view energy usage
- With charging capacity of 7.2kW, it's a little underpowered for the Bolt, which can charge at 7.7kW

The ChargePoint Home Flex charger is quite a bit of an upgrade.  Here are some of its features:
- It comes with either a NEMA 6-50 or 14-50 plug
- The "Flex" in its name refers to its adjustable charging amperage, from 16 to 50A
- It's WiFi connected, with the same ChargePoint app that we use to find charging stations for "refueling" while we're on the road
- The charging cord is one of the longest available at 23-feet

Our current charger uses a NEMA 6-50 plug, so being able to have that option means that we can just take out the old charger and plug in the new one.  We're also fortunate to having done the wiring with 6-gauge wire, so we can support the fastest charging rate.

We opted for the plug-in configuration, which means we're limited to charging at a max of 40A.  However, the Bolt only pulls 32A, so we're covered.  It's nice to have the ability to charge at a faster rate should we acquire a future vehicle which does support it.  It's unlikely that future mainstream BEVs will support higher than 40A charging, because of the demands on the household electrical system.

The 23-foot charging cord is plenty for our cars, which have the charging port at the front.  However, it's conceivable that our future car might have one at the back.  Or we may want to charge a guest's car parked behind our own.

The app lets you change the charging speed after installation.  Although it's most likely a set-once and forget setting, we like the flexibility, again, for a future vehicle.

The LED indicator on the front of the charger lets you see its status at a glance.  Green means it's ready, blue means its plugged in but not charging, pulsing blue means means it's charging the car.  White (no Wifi) and red (error) are bad.

Overall it's a polished, intuitive and, so far, reliable product.  We haven't had to go to the gas station for years and won't have to for the foreseeable future.
