We were an early adopter of the Chevrolet Bolt BEV, having owned one since its introductory year of 2017.  In 2020 after our other car, one with a conventional engine, broke down, we went out and got another Bolt.  Our first "Level 2" EV charger was a Siemens Versicharge.  It has been a capable charger and it was quite inexpensive.  However, it has a few shortcomings:
- It's a bit bulky.  We now mount it on a column in the middle of the garage where it can be a bit in the way.  At the time, it was one of the few chargers that lets you plug the charging cord connector into the front of the unit.  But in practice we mostly wrap the cord around the unit and let the connector hang to the side.
- It lacks connectivity, so we can't monitor when it's done charging or view energy usage data
- With charging capacity of 7.2kW, it's underpowered for the Bolt, which can charge at 7.7kW

The ChargePoint Home Flex charger is quite a bit of an upgrade.  Here are some of its features:
- The "Flex" in its name refers to its adjustable charging amperage, from 16 to 50A
- Wi-Fi connectivity 
- It's managed with the same ChargePoint app that we use to find charging stations for "refueling" while on the road
- The charging cord is one of the longest available at 23-feet
- Out of the box it can be installed in either a plug-in or a hard-wired configuration, the latter enabling for the fastest charging rates
- It's available with either a NEMA 6-50 or 14-50 plug

Our current charger uses a NEMA 6-50 plug, so being able to have that option means that we can just take out the old charger and plug in the new one.  We're also fortunate to having done the wiring with 6-gauge wire, so we can support the fastest charging rate of 50

We opted for the plug-in configuration, which means we're limited to charging at a max of 40A.  However, the Bolt only pulls 32A, so we're covered.  It's nice to have the ability to charge at a faster rate should we acquire a future vehicle which does support it.  It's unlikely that future mainstream BEVs will support higher than 40A charging, because of the increased demands on the household electrical system.

The 23-foot charging cord is plenty for our cars, which have the charging port at the front.  However, it's conceivable that our future car might have one at the back.  Or we may want to charge a guest's car parked behind our own.

The app lets you change the charging speed after installation.  Although it's most likely a set-once and forget setting, we like the flexibility, again, for a future vehicle.

The LED ring on the front of the charger lets you see its status at a glance.  Green means it's ready, blue means its plugged in but not charging, pulsing blue means means charging is in progress.  White (no Wi-Fi) and red (error) indicate that something is amiss.

Overall it's a polished, intuitive and, so far, reliable product.  We haven't had to go to the gas station for years and won't have to for the foreseeable future.
